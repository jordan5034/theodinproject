            <p>Ogórkowa, or Polish Dill Pickle Soup, is a traditional Polish soup made with pickled cucumbers, potatoes, and carrots. It has a unique tangy flavor and is often served with a dollop of sour cream.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 medium (approx. 6 oz, 170 g) carrots</li>
                <li>3 medium (approx. 6 oz, 170 g) parsley roots</li>
                <li>1/4 (approx. 4 oz, 120 g) celery root</li>
                <li>1 leek (the white part)</li>
                <li>1.5 lb (0.7 kg) veal on the bone - can be swapped for pork ribs, or poultry (wings, legs etc)</li>
                <li>12 cups (3 litres) water</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>3 all-spice berries</li>
                <li>5-6 medium dill pickles in brine</li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>4 medium (approx. 13 oz, 370 g) potatoes</li>
                <li>dill pickle juice</li>
                <li>10 fl oz (300 ml) sour cream, 18% fat (can be replaced with natural yoghurt)</li>
                <li>2-3 tbsp dill, chopped</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Peel the vegetables, chop roughly into large pieces. If your meat is in one big piece, divide it a bit as well.</li>
                <li>Place all the veggies and the meat in a large cooking pot (I use a 5 qt / 5 litres pot).</li>
                <li>Pour the water in (enough to cover all the ingredients), and bring it to boil. Reduce the heat, add the spices and cook slowly. If scum appears, get rid of it with a slotted spoon.</li>
                <li>Peel the pickles, grate them on a box grater (large holes). If you’re using a food processor, make sure the pickles won’t turn into ‘mush’.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a small pot, add grated pickles, cover with a lid. Braise them for 8-10 minutes or so, stirring occasionally. Make sure they don’t stick to the pot.</li>
                <li>Let's check the main pot. When the meat comes off the bone (it can take 1.5 to 2 hours), take the soup off the heat. Gently pour the stock through a sieve into another pot.</li>
                <li>Peel 4 medium potatoes, chop them into cubes and add to the stock. Cook for 20 minutes on medium heat, until potatoes are almost soft.</li>
                <li>Add grated pickles and a few tablespoons of pickle juice. Have a taste - add more juice if you feel that the soup needs it.</li>
                <li>Add selected meat pieces, you can also add sliced carrot and parsley we’ve cooked.</li>
                <li>Grab a small pot of sour cream, add some hot stock into it. Mix well with a fork, then add some more stock, mix again. Then add that creamy mixture into the soup.</li>
                <li>Add chopped dill and season with salt and pepper. Have a taste and add more seasoning if needed.</li>
            </ol>
