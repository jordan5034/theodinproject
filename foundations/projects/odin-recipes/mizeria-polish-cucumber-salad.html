            <p>Mizeria, or Polish Cucumber Salad, is a refreshing and creamy salad made with cucumbers, radishes, and a tangy yogurt-sour cream dressing. It's a perfect side dish for summer meals.</p>
            
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4-5 large cucumbers (approx. 3 pounds, 1.4 kg); English/hothouse; see notes</li>
                <li>6-7 radishes, optional</li>
                <li>1 medium (4 ounces, 110 gram) red onion; optional</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>3 cups (24 ounces, 700 ml) plain whole milk yogurt, unsweetened; see notes</li>
                <li>2 cups (16 ounces, 470-500 ml) sour cream, 18-20% fat</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar, or lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sugar, optional</li>
                <li>8 tablespoons (0.3 ounces, 9-10 grams) fresh dill, chopped</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon black pepper, freshly ground; optional</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the cucumbers and radishes under cold running water.</li>
                <li>[Peeling] There’s no need to peel this type of cucumbers, as the skin is edible and very thin. I prefer to peel the cucumbers anyway, only leaving ½ of one cucumber unpeeled (mainly for a visual effect).</li>
                <li>Slice the cucumbers through their length into thin medallions. Repeat with the radishes. Set aside.</li>
                <li>[Optional] Cut the onion in half, peel back the skin. Place the onion halves cut side down, and slice them finely into half-moons.</li>
                <li>Drop sliced vegetables (cucumbers, radishes, onion) into a large bowl. Sprinkle one and a half tablespoons of salt and mix everything with a spoon. The aim is to coat the cucumbers with salt evenly.</li>
                <li>Move the veggies into a colander (or a large sieve). Place a large bowl underneath it - it can be the same bowl we have just used, there’s no need for extra cleaning. Cover with a plastic wrap, so the cukes won’t dry up and chill in the fridge for 4-5 hours; or even overnight. We’re not done here just yet though, follow the next step.</li>
                <li>Line a fine-mesh sieve (large enough to hold 24 ounces or 700 ml) with a cheesecloth (loose-woven gauze) or a piece of paper towel. Place it over a bowl.</li>
                <li>Pour the yogurt in, and cover the whole thing with cling film. Again, refrigerate for 4-5 hours; or overnight. We’re done here, for now. See you in a few hours!</li>
                <li>Retrieve both bowls from the refrigerator. Unwrap them and discard the excess liquid that has collected at the bottom.</li>
                <li>Roll the vegetables in paper towels (or a clean kitchen towel) to dry them up and press out any excess juices.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add in the yogurt, sour cream, vinegar, sugar, dill, and black pepper. Whisk the dressing together, then add in all the vegetables.</li>
                <li>Toss well and have a taste. We have salted the cucumbers well before, but some of that salt will be gone at this point. I usually add one more teaspoon of salt, but you might need two.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate for a few hours before serving, so that the flavours can develop and blend together. If you’re impatient, you can serve it immediately.</li>
                <li>Right before serving, you can sprinkle ‘Mizeria’ lightly with salt, ground pepper, and a few dill twigs.</li>
